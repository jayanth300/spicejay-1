<p style="font-size:1.2em;text-align:center;line-height: 1.5;"> Spices are used in different forms: whole, chopped, ground, roasted, sautéed, fried, and as a topping.<br> They blend food to extract the nutrients and bind them in a palatable form. Some spices are added at the end as a flavouring — those are<br> typically heated in a pan with ghee (Indian clarified butter) or cooking oil before being added to a dish. Lighter spices are added last, and spices with strong flavour should be added first. "Curry" refers to any dish in Indian cuisine that contains several spices blended together, <br>whether dry or with a gravy base. However, it also refers to curry leaves, commonly used in South India.
